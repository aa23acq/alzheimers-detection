### Alzheimer's Detection Using Deep Learning

This web application allows users to classify MRI images into Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer's Disease categories using deep learning models (ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet).

#### Project Highlights:
- **Dataset**: OASIS dataset from Kaggle
- **Models**: ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet
- **Goal**: Assist in early detection of Alzheimer's Disease to improve patient care.

You can upload an MRI image to see the classification results and explore the project insights.

    This project is aimed at using deep learning models to classify brain MRI scans into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
    
    ### Models Used:
    - **ResNet**: Known for its residual connections, which help in training very deep neural networks.
    - **VGGNet**: A convolutional neural network known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification.
    - **AlexNet**: One of the earlier architectures that showed the power of deep learning in image classification.

    ### Dataset:
    - The dataset used for this project is the OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) MRI dataset, which includes Normal, MCI, and Alzheimer's Disease categories.
    """)
with tab4:
    st.header("Next Steps and Future Work")
    st.write("""
To improve the performance and robustness of the models, several avenues for future work have been identified:
- **Dataset Merging**: Merging datasets like OASIS and ADNI to provide a larger, more diverse dataset for training. This will help models generalize better across different patient populations.
- **Model Annotation for Continuous Learning**: Developing systems where new MRI data can be continuously added and annotated, allowing the models to improve over time with active learning techniques.
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying pre-trained models on large-scale datasets to new MRI datasets using transfer learning can improve generalization and reduce the risk of overfitting.
- Potential for improving models by exploring other architectures (e.g., DenseNet, Inception)
- Need for larger, more diverse datasets
- Integration of multimodal data (e.g., MRI + PET scans)
""")

# Generalization Challenges Section
st.write("## Challenges in Generalization")
st.write("""
While the models perform well on the OASIS dataset, they face certain challenges when generalizing to other datasets:
- **Overfitting**: The relatively small size of the OASIS dataset can lead to overfitting, where the models perform well on the training data but fail to generalize to unseen data.
- **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Performance often drops when applying these models to different datasets such as ADNI or clinical data, indicating a need for better generalization techniques.
- **Need for Multi-Modal Data**: Incorporating other types of data (e.g., PET scans, clinical history) could provide a more comprehensive view and improve diagnostic accuracy.
